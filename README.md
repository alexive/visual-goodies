[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-visual--goodies-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/1/4100)

The purpose of this library is to provide an easy way to implement some of the the eye-candy lists/cards/and some other widgets Google demonstrates on the Material Design Guidelines.
Checkout some of the features below.

## Lists
The goal was to mimic the lists (and Grids) shown at [Google's Material Design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/lists.html#lists-specs) (or hybrids of them) with just a few lines of code:
```java
ListAdapter mAdapter = new ListAdapter(){
    //Use GridAdapter if you need a grid (or an hybrid)
    @Override
    public String getSubHeaderText(int i) {/*If you have subheaders, text'd go here*/}

    @Override
    public int getNumItems(){/*Number of list items go here*/}

    @Override
    public void bindDataToListItem(int i, View view, ImageView imageView, ImageButton
            imageButton, TextView... textViews) {
        //Here you actually compose the list item
        //i is the index
        //view is the item's view
        //imageView is an image (the one at the left)
        //imageButton same (at the right)
        //textViews are the textfields, from top to bottom, left to right
        //These will depend on the method below
    }

    @Override
    public ListItemType getListItemDataType(int i) {/*return the list item at index i's type*/}
```
#### Also you can:
* add an header view (```listAdapter.addHeaderView(view)```)
* add dividers between the list items (``` listAdapter.setDividerStyle(DividerStyle.JUST_SUB_HEADERS)```, other options are only above dividers, or none (default)). You'll need to set their color: (```listAdapter.setDividerColor(Divider.MATERIAL_LIGHT_DIVIDER_COLOR)```, or ```MATERIAL_DARK_DIVIDER_COLOR```)
* add click/long click listener (```listAdapter.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener(){ ... })```)
* Turn the avatars/buttons into checkboxes (```listAdapter.setShowCheckboxes(true)```)
* Same as above but in an ActionMode (```startSupportActionMode(new ListAdapter.ListCheckingActionMode(listAdapter)```)
* Make the adapter to display a view when the list is empty (```listAdapter.setEmptyView(view)```)

#### Example:
| <img src="images/sample1.gif" width="150"/> | <img src="images/sample2.png" width="150"/> |

## RecyclerViewFragment
It's basically a fragment with a RecyclerView. Just extend this class, override onViewCreated, and then you can access these methods (even if you don't use this library's adapters):
* ```setAdapter(adapter)```
* ```setEmptyText(text)```, ```setEmptyView(view)```
* ```setOnItemClickListener(listener)```, ```setOnItemLongClickListener(listener)```
* suggestions are welcome!

## Dialogs
Instead of playing with ```AlertDialog.Builder``` class each time you need a dialog...
* Create a simple message dialog with a one-liner:```MessageDialog.show(getActivity(), "title here", "hey what\'s up?")```
* Ask confirmation: ```MessageDialog.askConfirmation(getActivity(), "title here", "msg here", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener(){...})```
* A number within a range ```new NumberPickerDialog(getActivity(), Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE).show(new NumberPickerDialog.NumberPickerListener() {...}```
* Text that fits some parameters:
```java
new TextInputDialog(getActivity()).setInputPolicy(new TextInputDialog.InputPolicy() {
    @Override
    public String isTextAcceptable(String s) {
        if (s.equals("asdfghjkl"))
            return "what?"; //what the user wrote is not okay
        return null; //What the user wrote is fine
    }
}).show(new TextInputDialog.TextListener() {
    @Override
    public void onTextAccepted(String s) {
        //isTextAcceptable(s) returned null and the user accepted
    }
});
```

## CardBuilder
The intent is to create a Card like the ones at [Google's MD guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html) with just a few lines (and not having to create layout files)

[Check the demo project](/demo/src/main/java/com/alexive/graphicalutils/demo/CardsActivity.java) for a complete sample on how to use the CardBuilder. The result is this:

| <img src="images/sample3.png" width="150"/> | <img src="images/sample4.png" width="150"/> | <img src="images/sample5.png" width="150"/> | <img src="images/sample6.png" width="150"/> |


## Proportional Image View
Self-explanatory, can restrict an image to 16:9, 4:3, 1:1 or just be like a regular ImageView

## View Utils
Transforms plenty of methods (some that usually require checking the sdk version, not null, etc) to a single line method call.
* `setBackgroundDrawable(view, drawable)`
* ~~`getDrawable(drawable)`~~ ContextCompat already has a method for that!
* `animateSetViewVisibilityGone(view)` / `animateSetViewVisibilityVisible(view)` makes a view disappear/appear with style
* `createCircularReveal(view)` / `createCircularRevealInverse(view)`
* `convertDPtoPixels(context, dp)`

## Use it in your project
In your project's root build.gradle, add `maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }` at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```
Then, in your module's build.gradle, add `compile 'com.github.alexive:visual-goodies:-SNAPSHOT'` to the dependencies:
```
dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.alexive:visual-goodies:-SNAPSHOT'
    }
```

I'll be updating this repo often (usually bug fixes) so, if you want, tell gradle to check for a new version at every build.
Add to your module's build.gradle:
```
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.cacheChangingModulesFor 0, 'seconds'
}
```

## Suggest/Contribute
Any suggestions (and contributions) will be greatly appreciated.
The same thing goes for any bugs you find. Just file up an issue and I'll look it up ASAP.

## Demo project
If you want to try the demo project, just clone the repo, uncomment the project's root
settings.gradle and you can go from there.
In a one-liner:

`git clone https://github.com/alexive/visual-goodies.git && cd visual-goodies && echo "include ':library', ':demo'" > settings.gradle`

Then open the project on Android Studio and run the demo module

## Apps that use this library
None yet! If your use it in your app, feel free to open up an issue and i'll just mention it here

## Why I did this
After learning to code and doing a few Android apps just for me to learn, I found myself writing the same code over and over again. Then, in college, I realized I could reuse the code, so I decided to move the repeated parts onto a separate project tweak it a bit and voil√†! This includes list adapters, dialogs, cards, etc

## Wishlist (or TODO):
* Swipeable list items
* Drag and drop to reorder
* Pull to refresh
* Even more cards
